# Graze Plugins

Graze provides a simple but powerful plugins system.

Unlike components that you might create on a per site or app the plugins system is designed to access the low-level APIs to easily modify the functionality of Graze at the different life-cycle stages of your project.

## Configuration File

The configuration file for Graze allows different functionality to be added to a project.

The configuration file should be named `graze.config.js` and placed at the root of your project and contain the relevant named exports.

Currently the only supported export is `plugins`.

Example `graze.config.js`:

```js
export const plugins = [
  require('./src/plugins/graze-styled-components'),
  require('./src/plugins/graze-material-ui'),
  require('./src/plugins/graze-tutorial'),
  require('./src/plugins/graze-graphcms'),
  {
    module: require('./src/plugins/graze-ga'),
    trackingId: 'UA-138092593-2',
    gaOptions: { name: 'graze-setup' }
  }
]

```

`plugins` export should be an array containing objects or require
statements like in the above example.

When passing a `require('...')` statement the loaded module will be
used.

When passing an object, it must contain a `module` property with the 
plugin module as value. The rest of the properties are passed in as the plugins `options`, as canbe be see in the `react-ga` example.

## Plugin Structure

A Graze plugin is composed of three directives: **server**, **client**, and **app**, each of which is executed according to the plugins needs.

A plugin module is expected to export one or more directives to function properly.

Each of the directives contains an **activation function** that will signal to graze that the plugin needs to do something, and depending on the directive it will contain **Wrapper** components, **wrapper** functions, and **output** functions.

export const MyMenus = props => {
  const plugins = false
  return (

                <li key={`items ${item.name}`}><Link to={item.route}>{item.name}</Link></li>
              ))
          )}
        </ul>
      </div>
    </>
  )
}
