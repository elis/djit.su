# Getting Started with Djitsu

Djitsu is an editor, application, and an execution platform all rolled into one - it allows you to write regular good-old Javascript (for now, later it will support more languages), without any platform-specific APIs or other platform lockins, so you can be sure that any code written out-side of djitsu will work on djitsu, and any code written in djitsu is just regular code you can use anywhere else.

A great place to start is:

- [Getting Started with Djitsu](https://djit.su/@elis/djitsu-101) - getting to know the basics of how to use djitsu 
- [Javascript in Djitsu](https://djit.su/@elis/javascript-in-djitsu) - diving a bit deeper on how to interact with the javascript code in djitsu
